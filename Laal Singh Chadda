'Laal Singh Chadda' had a strong technical backing. Pritam's songs are very good and the lyrics are fantastic. 
Tanuj's background score is equally good and Satyajit Pandey's visuals are amazing. 
The soul of the movie is perfectly captured by the director of photography. 
The production values are top notch and they did not compromise on anything. 
Writer Atul Kulkarni did a very good job in giving an Indian backdrop to 'Forrest Gump' story. 
Advait failed in the casting stage itself and he failed to make his mark. 
Since it is an Aamir Khan film, he will be taking the lion's share of the blame for its failure.
